        <p>Here's a little bit about myself, I like to try all kinds of food places and coffee/tea spots. All about that coffee yo! Recently I've been starting work at 5 and that caffeine helps greatly due to lack of sleep. Funny thing is that when I took the picture to the left I was so tired that even though my eyes don't look so open, I was straining my eyes to get them open to that point lol.
        <br>
        I've been in construction for 12 years with U.A. Local 483. Last year I was on disability for 3 months due to a shoulder injury and went back to work in November.
